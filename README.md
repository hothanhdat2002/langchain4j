## Features

- **Multi-Model Support**: Integrate with models from OpenAI, Hugging Face, and others.
- **Embeddings**: Utilize various embedding techniques for improved data representation.
- **Vector Database Integration**: Work seamlessly with databases like Milvus, Pinecone, and Weaviate.
- **Chat Interfaces**: Build chatbots using the latest AI technologies.
- **Customizability**: Easily extend and customize the framework to fit your needs.

## Getting Started

To get started with langchain4j, you can clone this repository and set up your environment. Follow the steps below to set up your first project.

### Installation

You can install langchain4j using Maven. Add the following dependency to your `pom.xml`:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.example</groupId>
    <artifactId>langchain4j</artifactId>
    <version>1.0.0</version>
</dependency>
```

Make sure to replace `1.0.0` with the latest version available in the [Releases](https://github.com/hothanhdat2002/langchain4j/releases) section.

### Usage

Here‚Äôs a quick example to get you started:

```java
import com.example.langchain4j.*;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        LangChain langChain = new LangChain();
        String response = langChain.chat("Hello, how can I help you?");
        System.out.println(response);
    }
}
```

This simple program initializes a LangChain instance and sends a chat message. You can expand this to create more complex interactions.
